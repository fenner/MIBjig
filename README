MIBjig takes the text output of an snmpwalk command and parses the data to
fake those same values via a Net-SNMP Agent Extension. 

For example, you can do a walk of a particular device and then have MIBjig
present those same SNMP OIDs and values via a host running Net-SNMP. 

The walk must be done in Numeric Output mode (-On). Example:

snmpwalk -v 1 -On -c [community] [address] [start oid] > walk.txt

MIBjig can then be used to present those same OIDs via the local host
assuming it is using Net-SNMP and has the 'master agentx' line in its
snmpd.conf file. Exampke:

sudo ./mibjig -f walk.txt

The -f argument specifies to run in foreground and the last argument is the
text file containing the output of the snmpwalk done with the -On parameter. 

If successful, the following output show appear:

No log handling enabled - turning on stderr logging
NET-SNMP version 5.4.2.1 AgentX subagent connected

If mibjig is unable to connect to the parent Net-SNMP process, ensure snmpd
is running and has the 'master agentx' configuration line in the snmpd.conf
file usually found in /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf

When doing the snmpwalk from the source device, it is best to limit the walk
to the enterprises or experimental portions of the MIB so that you do not
double-up on the common MIBs that are already implemented by Net-SNMP. That
is, the input walk file should only contain OIDs that are not already
present on the system when running Net-SNMP.
